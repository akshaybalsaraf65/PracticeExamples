//	Abstraction :
//
//		 hiding internal implementation and just hightly set of services of we are offering is a concept of abstraction
//
//		example :
//
//		through bank atm GUI screen bank people  hightly set of services what they are offering 
//		without hightling internal implementation
//
//		Advantage of abstraction :
//
//		 => Seacurity : the main advantage abstraction are 
//		                we can achive security becasuse we are not hightly over internal implementation
//		 => enhasment : without affacting outside person we can able to perform any type to changes in internal system 
//						hence enhasment will become easy 
//		 => improve easy : it improves maintain abily of the application
//		 => maintain ability : it improve easyness to use over system
//
//		by using interfaces and abstract classes we can implement abstraction
