	 * example 1. by implementing seriziable interfaces over objects can be saved to

	 * interfaces over object or position to produce axectly duplicate clone object
	 * 
	 * // ? // without having any methods how the object get some ability in marker
	 * interfaces // ans // internally JVM is responsible to provide required
	 * ability
	 * 
	 * // ? // why JVM is provide required ability in marker interfaces // ans // to
	 * reduce complicity of programming and to make java language as simple
	 * 
	 * // ? // Is it possible create over own marker interface // ans // Yes , but
	 * customization JVM is required
